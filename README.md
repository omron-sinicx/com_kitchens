## Dataset Details

This COMKitchens dataset provides cooking videos annotated with a structured visual action graph.
The dataset currently has two benchmarks:

- Dense Video Captioning on unedited fixed-viewpoint videos (DVC-FV)
- Online Recipe Retrieval (OnRR)

We provide all the dataset for the benchmarks and attach `.dat` files which represent the train/validation/test split.

### File Structure

```sh

### Download Procedure for COM Kitchens

> \[!NOTE\]
> [Application Form](https://www.nii.ac.jp/dsc/idr/rdata/COM_Kitchens/)
> English support will be available soon.

## Quick Start

### Dataset Preparation

1. Dataset Preparation
   1. Download annotation files and videos.
2. Preprocess
   1. Run `python -m com_kitchens.preprocess.video` for extracting all frames of the videos.
   2. Run `python -m com_kitchens.preprocess.recipe` for extracting all action-by-person entries of the videos.

> \[!WARNING\]
> While we extract all frames in preprocess for simplicity, you can save disk storage space by extracting only the frames you use with the annotation files.

### Online Recipe Retrieval (OnRR)

1. Training
   1. Run `sh scripts/onrr-train-xclip.sh` for simple start of trainings.
2. Evaluation
   1. Run `sh scripts/onrr-eval-xclip.sh {your/path/to/ckpt}` for the evaluation.

#### Training UniVL models in OnRR

For UniVL, we are required to extract s3d features of the videos.

1. Download `s3d_howto100m.pth` to `cache/s3d_howto100m.pth` or other path you configure.
2. Run `sh scripts/extract_s3d_features.sh` to extract s3d features.
3. Download pretrained model `univl.pretrained.bin` to `cache/univl.pretrained.bin` or other path you configure.
4. Then you can run `sh scripts/onrr-train-univl.sh` to train UniVL models.

### Dense Video Captioning on unedited fixed-viewpoint videos (DVC-FV)

1. Docker Images
   1. Run `make build-docker-images` to build docker images.
2. Preprocess
   1. Run `sh scripts/dvc-vid2seq-prep` to extract 
3. Training & Evaluation
   1. Run `sh scripts/vid2seq-zs.sh` to evaluate a pre-trained vid2seq model
   2. Run `sh scripts/vid2seq-ft.sh` to fine-tune and evaluate a vid2seq model
   3. RUn `sh scripts/vid2seq-ft-rl-as.sh` to fine-tune and evaluate a vid2seq model incorporating action graph as both relation labels and attention supervision (*RL+AS*)
